            Help Center pages provide information about how to use a particular
            product or service. The main purpose of these pages is to support
            users and help them find answers to their questions. They can also
            provide information on the productâ€™s functionalities, as well as its
            core features and limitations.
          </p>
          <p>
            These pages are great resources for both businesses and users, as
            they allow the latter to independently find answers and solutions
            and businesses to reduce costs by not investing in direct customer
            support. Well-designed help center pages are user-friendly,
            organized, and regularly updated to ensure that users have access to
            accurate and relevant information.

            What is the difference between a help center and a support page?
          </h5>
          <p>
            Help Center pages are resources or guides to help users find
            answers. On the other hand, support pages incorporate chatbots,
            email links, forms, etc. to provide a form of direct support to the
            users.

            What should a well-designed help centre page include?
          </h5>
          <p>
            As a general guideline, it should include at least the following
            areas:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Product Documentation:</strong> This is a technical
              document that outlines all the main details of your
              product/service. It is a guide that allows users to get maximum
              value by including product specifications, instructions, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong> The FAQ section
              allows users to access popular topics to solve their problems. It
              is a time-saving asset for both the user and the owner.
            </li>
